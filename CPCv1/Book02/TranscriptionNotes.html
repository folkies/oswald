    <h2>Transcription Notes for James Oswald's "Caledonian Pocket Companion" Collection</h2>
  <br>1770s, 1780s
  </center>

  James Oswald published at least a dozen booklets, mostly with around 30 pages of tunes
  including  variations,  in  the  1770s  and  1780s.   They weren't actually dated, and
  historians have estimated the  dates  from  various  clues  from  many  sources.   His
  terminology  is  a  bit  confused  with both the original booklets and the two (known)
  combined collections of 6 of them into one book are called "volumes".  See

    https://hummingadifferenttune.blogspot.com/2014/10/james-oswalds-caledonian-pocket.html
  for an idea of the mess these collections preset for archivers.

<p>
  Scanned images of the full set appeared on the National  Library  of  Scotland's  site
  (www.nls.uk) in 2018, and by 2020, archive.org had a subset that includes the original
  12 books.  I took on the project of transcribing them to ABC  notation,  to  make  the
  material  more  widely  available.   The  more historically included may want to visit
  nls.uk and get your own copy of the originals.

<p>
  One bit of oddity is that Volume 2 appeared online  (nls.uk  and  archive.org)  before
  Volume  1,  and  their organization is a bit different.  Volume 1 contains the first 6
  "books", complete with title pages and the original page numbers (1 thru  36  or  so),
  plus  a  set  of  6  indexes  at the end.  Volume 2 contains only a single title page,
  followed by a combined semi-alphabetical index, then  the  tune  pages  (1-162).   The
  original books 7-12 are labelled in handwriting, but otherwise Vol.2 has no indication
  of  the  original  6  booklets'  boundaries.   This  structure  is  mirrored  in   the
  subdirectories  here,  with  the CPC directory containing CPCv1 and CPCvv2.  CPCv1 has
  subdirectories CPCv1/Book01 thru CPCv1/Book06 which contain the tunes in those  books,
  while  CPCv2  contains  all  the  tunes  from  the originasl Books 7-12, with the page
  numbers 1-162 used in the single-tune file names.

<p>
  Each tune has been transcribed in a separate file.  These can be combined into  larger
  files by various software, depending on how you are using them.

  For the 1st volume, the pages aren't consequitively numbered; they start over at  page
  1  for  each  of  the  6  books.   There are fewer than 100 pages in each book, so the
  convention adopted here is to use file names of the form 1BPPN_Tune_Title.abc, where B
  is the book number (1-6), PP is the page number (01-36), and N is the tune counter for
  the page. A few tunes are across two pages; they are numbered on their first page, and
  the first full tune on the next page is counted as tune 1.

  For the 2nd volume, the single-tune file names have a simpler naming convention, since
  the  pages were renumbered for the collection.  There are more than 99 numbered pages,
  so the file names are of the form 2PPPN_Tune_Title.abc, where 2 is the volume  number,
  PPP  is  the  page  number,  N is the tune number on the page, '_' is a separator, and
  Tune_Title is the title with '_' for spaces and mixed capitalization that follows  the
  modern  practice  of  major  words capitalized.  Initial articles are not capitalized,
  which makes it easy for software to alphabetize  by  simply  ignoring  all  characters
  before the first upper-case letter. This naming scheme produces the same tune order as
  the book, and can be useful with a lot of music software.

  A few tunes have -V1.abc or -V2.abc at the end of the file name.  These are tunes with
  two  transcriptions,  for  versions  1.* and 2.* of the ABC notation.  These deal with
  things like occasional double "voices" in  some  measures,  or  dynamic  markings  not
  implemented  in  ABC  1.*,  etc.  There aren't many instances where ABC 2 features are
  needed, and they can usually be approximated easily in ABC 1, but when they occur, the
  -V2.abc file is the most accurate transcription.

<p>
  This was published before I and J had stabilized as different letters. The index has a
  single  'I'  section  that has a mix of titles starting with I or J.  Sometimes 'J' is
  used where 'I' would be in the modern spelling, and the appropriate modern  letter  is
  transcribed.

<p>
  This collection is somewhat inconsistent in its repeat notation.  It seems  to  mostly
  use  :||:  as  a  single  token meaning "Repeat the previous", but sometimes has thick
  double bars without the dots.  These cases are transcribed as-is,  as  nearly  as  ABC
  allows.  There is also common use of ... :||: ... :||: which is usually transcribed as
  |: ...  :: ...  :|, which is the modern notation for "Repeat  all  the  strains."  The
  initial  |:  is  usually  omitted  when  there's  an initial "pickup" (anacrucis), but
  included if the tune starts on a downbeat.  This is  sometimes  suggested  as  a  good
  approach,  partly  to help software determine which initial notes are significant, and
  also useful for multi-note beginnings to emphasize where the downbeat is.

  (In Oct 2019, I finally noticed that I hadn't increased the year  in  the  Z:  fields,
  which  were  all dated 2018.  So I wrote a little script that rewrote all the dates in
  the files 2061*.abc throuth 2110*.abc, which were transcribed from  March  to  October
  2019.  Sorry 'bout that. This has been an on-and-off project, worked on during various
  periods with sufficient free time. ;-)
