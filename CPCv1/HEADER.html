  Volume 1 of The Caledonian Pocket Companion contains the first 6 booklets
  in the series.  They were basically just concatenated, with an added
  title page for the book, plus an index at the end that contains the 6
  indexes from the 6 booklets. The indexes were joined, but not merged,
  so finding a title required searching each booklet's index until you
  found it.  The titles were merely grouped under their first letter,
  but weren't in alphatical order.
<p>
  It doesn't help the user of the 6-booklet "Volume" that the original
  page numbers (1 to around 30) were kept, but the tunes themselves
  weren't numbered.  
<p>
  What has been done here is to use a file name starting with a 5-digit
  number of the form VBPPN, where V is the volume (1 in this directory),
  B is the book number (1-56), PP is the page number (1-36), and N is
  the tune title's count on the page.  Some tunes overflow from one page
  to another, and only their first page number is used; the first tune
  title on the next page will be N=1, although there are staff lines at
  the top that are part of the preceding page's last tune. Each tune
  has its number in its X: header line.
<p>
  Note that Volume 2 uses a similar but not quite identical indexing scheme.
